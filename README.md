**Software engineer specializing in gameplay tooling, automation, and AI-assisted systems.**  
I design, implement, and maintain reliable software across scripting, backend services, and game-adjacent tooling. My work spans Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, and the C family, with a focus on performance, maintainability, and clear operational ownership.

## Competencies
- **Languages:** Python Â· JavaScript/TypeScript Â· Java Â· C/C++/C#
- **Domains:** Game plugins & utilities (FFXIV/Dalamud, OSRS/RuneLite) Â· Automation & bots (e.g., Discord) Â· Data processing Â· Tooling & CLIs
- **Practices:** Code review Â· Test automation Â· Robust error handling Â· Performance tuning Â· Clear documentation

## What I Do
- **Gameplay tooling:** Plugins and utilities for **Final Fantasy XIV** and **Old School RuneScape**, improving quality of life, observability, and efficiency.
- **Automation & bots:** Discord integrations, task orchestration, and workflow automation for communities and projects.
- **AI-assisted development:** Integration of LLMs and classical automation to accelerate analysis, refactoring, and repetitive tasksâ€”always with explicit safety and control.

## Working Style
- **Precise and methodical:** Clear scope, measurable outcomes, and audited changesets.
- **Independent or collaborative:** Comfortable owning an initiative end-to-end or contributing within established codebases.
- **Security & reliability minded:** Defensive coding, minimal privileges, and predictable release processes.
